# Automatic Door Closer
This project uses a servo motor and an Arduino microcontroller to create an automated door closure system. A sensor built into the system will identify when the door is opened. Once the sensor is triggered the door will close smoothly when the servo motor is activated and winds up a string that is fastened to the door.
